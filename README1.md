  <h3 align="center"> Capstone Proposal: A Short-Term Forecasting Model for WTI Oil Prices </h3>

## TI. Background

**Crude oil is arguably one of the most important commodity that power the engine of the global economy. Decline in oil prices would result in a modest boost to the overall global economic activity, although the oil producers may suffer income losses. Reference research from the World Bank shows that for every 30% decline of oil prices, the global GDP (Gross Domestic Product) would be increased by 0.5%. At the same time, the drop of oil prices would reduce the cost of living, and hence the inflation rate would fall. The dynamics of oil prices results in an increased sense of economic uncertainty for all countries. Oil importers face uncertainty about import costs exchange rate and fuel subsidy levels, while oil exporters face volatile revenues.
There is no doubt that crude oil price forecasts are very useful to industries, governments as well as individuals. Thus, forecasting crude oil prices has been the subject of many researches by both academia and industry. However, due to the high volatility of oil prices, it remains one of the most challenging forecasting problems.
We Plan to tackle this proposal by using publicly available data for oil prices, oil demand, supply and inventories. Data was collected from Energy Information Administration (EIA), Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center (KAPSARC)..**

## II. Objectives

   **The purpose of this work is to identify factors that affect the price of oil and to obtain a reliable forecast model of oil prices. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to perform a number of tasks:
Study the factors influencing the price of oil.
Consider the method of forecasting using time-series.
Collect and conduct descriptive data analysis.**
